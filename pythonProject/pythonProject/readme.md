# Interpretation of Results

## Hypothesis Testing: 
If the p-value is less than 0.05, we can conclude that there is a significant difference in the perceived usefulness of social media between male and female students.
## Regression Analysis: 
The regression model will provide coefficients that indicate the relationship between perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. A significant coefficient suggests that perceived ease of use is a predictor of perceived usefulness.
## Clustering: 
The scatter plot will show how students cluster based on their perceptions of social media ease of use and usefulness. This can help identify different groups of students and tailor educational strategies accordingly.
